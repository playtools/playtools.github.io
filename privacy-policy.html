        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Privacy Policy of P Tools. This notice explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your
            information when you visit our website. Please read it carefully to understand your rights and our
            obligations.</p>

        <h2>1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>
        <p>We collect minimal personal information to enhance user experience. Our site does not require login or
            signup. However, interactions such as contacting us or using specific features may involve data collection.
        </p>

        <h2>2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p>We process your data solely for providing services, improving user experience, and maintaining site
            functionality. We prioritize your privacy and ensure data is handled securely.</p>

        <h2>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p>We rely on legitimate interests and user consent where applicable. We do not process sensitive information
            without explicit consent.</p>

        <h3>Additional Legal Bases for Processing Technical and Anonymous Information</h3>
        <p>For technical personal data that would require consent, we rely on the following legal bases for processing
            technical and anonymous information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legitimate interest:</strong> We use this as a basis for processing technical information, such
                as your IP address or device data, to improve website functionality, user experience, and website
                analytics. As we do not collect personal data, you are not required to provide any consent.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p>Since P Tools does not collect personal information, we do not share any personal details with third parties.
            However, we may share anonymous data, such as analytics or usage statistics, with trusted third-party
            service providers who help us analyze website performance, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Website analytics tools:</strong> For example, services like Google Analytics, which track
                website traffic and user interactions. These tools help us improve the website but are not used to track
                personal data.</li>
            <li><strong>Ad services (if applicable):</strong> If we include third-party advertisements, they may collect
                anonymous data through cookies to serve relevant ads.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We ensure that any third-party services comply with privacy and data protection laws.</p>

        <h2>5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p>We retain your data only for as long as it is necessary to improve the website and fulfill the purposes
            outlined in this policy. Since the data we collect is anonymous and non-personal, it is stored temporarily
            and automatically deleted after a certain period based on our data retention practices.</p>
        <p><strong>Cookies:</strong> Cookies may be retained for varying durations, but you can manage or delete them at
            any time via your browser settings.</p>

        <h2>6. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
        <p>P Tools does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. We encourage parents or
            guardians to supervise the online activities of minors and ensure that no personal data is shared. If we
            become aware that we have inadvertently collected information from a minor, we will take immediate steps to
            delete that data.</p>

        <h2>7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
        <p>As we do not collect personal information, there are no privacy rights that need to be exercised. However,
            you are entitled to the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Manage cookies:</strong> You can control cookies through your browser settings and opt out of
                non-essential cookies at any time.</li>
            <li><strong>Opt-out of analytics services:</strong> If you do not wish to participate in website analytics,
                you can disable cookies from third-party analytics providers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not process personal data that would require a formal request for access, correction, or deletion.</p>

        <h2>8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
        <p>Some browsers allow you to set a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature. P Tools does not currently respond to DNT
            signals because we do not engage in the collection of personal data. However, you can still manage your
            cookies and tracking preferences directly through your browser settings.</p>

        <h2>9. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
        <p>Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), California residents have certain privacy rights regarding
            their personal data. However, since P Tools does not collect personal information, these rights do not
            apply. If you are a California resident and have any concerns, feel free to contact us for further
            clarification.</p>

        <h2>10. DATA LIABILITY</h2>
        <p>We make every effort to protect your information, but since we do not collect or store sensitive personal
            data, the risk of exposure is minimal. While we take reasonable precautions to secure any data collected, we
            cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat our security measures.</p>

        <h2>11. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h2>
        <p>Yes, we may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our services, technologies, or
            legal requirements. Any updates to this policy will be posted on this page, with the revision date updated
            accordingly. We recommend reviewing this page periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your
            information.</p>

        <h2>12. HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please feel free to reach out to us
            through our <a href="https://playtools.github.io/contact-us/index.html">Contact Us page</a>. We are
            committed to addressing your concerns promptly.</p>

        <h2>13. HOW CAN YOU REVIEW, UPDATE, OR DELETE THE DATA WE COLLECT FROM YOU?</h2>
        <p>Since P Tools does not collect personal information, there is no need for you to review, update, or delete
            any personal data. If you wish to manage the cookies and technical data we collect, you can do so by
            adjusting your browser settings to disable or delete cookies.</p>

        <h2>14. What Categories of Personal Information Do We Collect?</h2>
